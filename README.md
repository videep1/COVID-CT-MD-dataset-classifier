# COVID-CT-MD-dataset-classifier
The COVID-CT-MD dataset contains volumetric chest CT scans (DICOM files) of patients positive for COVID-19 (COV) infection,  patients with Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP), and normal (NORM) patients. Diagnosis of COVID-19 infection is based on positive real-time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) test results, clinical parameters, and CT scan manifestations identified by three experienced thoracic radiologists. Diagnosis for CAP and normal cases was confirmed using clinical laboratory tests, and CT scans.
